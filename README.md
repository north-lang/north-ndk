  <em>A programming language for everybody</em>

</div>

<br>

The skill of coding in various programming languages is quiet essential to understand the today's world. In order to promote this important component, in my final school project I designed a programming language that enables a high-quality web app to be created from a simple code snippet. This means that no previous knowledge is required when using the North programming language. 

The <a href="">technical documentation</a> clearly explains how to program with North. It also explains how to install and configure the language. It also contains a glossary that explains all the complicated technical terms.

The expected use case for North would be frontend development (Web). With this goal, it equips (but not limited to) the following features:

- thread/channel mechanism powered by JavaScripts's threads
- Builtin database library (encrypted FireBase)
- JSON support
- Crossplaform: MacOS, Windows 10, Linux, 
- Effective web-apps that are written as fast as nothing else.

> Note: North is just a school project. I might work in the future on this project to support better releases than yet.
